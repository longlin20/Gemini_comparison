This move effectively crippled Armenia's economy as 85% of its cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic.

In February 1944 the Japanese mounted a local counter-attack in the Arakan. After early Japanese success, this counter-attack was defeated when the Indian divisions of XV Corps stood firm, relying on aircraft to drop supplies to isolated forward units until reserve divisions could relieve them.\nSpanish was nonetheless the only official language in Galicia for more than four centuries.
