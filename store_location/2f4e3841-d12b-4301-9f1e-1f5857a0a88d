For example, Buddhism's emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various differing beliefs, customs and institutions in countries where it has resided throughout its history. Also, its moral and spiritual parallels with other systems of thought\u2014for example, with various tenets of Christianity\u2014have been subjects of close study. In addition, the Buddhist concept of dependent origination has been compared to modern scientific thought, as well as Western metaphysics.\nWith its growing popularity, professional wrestling has attracted attention as a subject of serious academic study and journalistic criticism. Many courses, theses, essays, and dissertations have analyzed wrestling's conventions, content, and its role in modern society. It is often included as part of studies on theatre, sociology, performance, and media. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a course of study on the cultural significance of professional wrestling, and anthropologist Heather Levi has written an ethnography about the culture of lucha libre in Mexico.\nTheravada (\"Doctrine of the Elders\", or \"Ancient Doctrine\") is the oldest surviving Buddhist school. It is relatively conservative, and generally closest to early Buddhism. The name Therav\u0101da comes from the ancestral Sth\u0101vir\u012bya, one of the early Buddhist schools, from which the Theravadins claim descent.

Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture. They also emphasized Theravada being rational and scientific.", "metadata": {"source": "data_file/context.txt"}}}
