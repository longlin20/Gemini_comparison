West\u2019s family, through celebrity attorney Ed McPherson, filed complaints with the Medical Board against Adams and Aboolian for violating patient confidentiality following her death. Adams had previously been under scrutiny by the medical board. He appeared on Larry King Live on November 20, 2007, but left before speaking. Two days later, he appeared again, with his attorney, stating he was there to \"defend himself\". He said that the recently released autopsy results \"spoke for themselves\". The final coroner's report January 10, 2008, concluded that Donda West died of \"coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors due to or as a consequence of liposuction and mammoplasty\".\nCommensal relationships may involve one organism using another for transportation (phoresy) or for housing (inquilinism), or it may also involve one organism using something another created, after its death (metabiosis). Examples of metabiosis are hermit crabs using gastropod shells to protect their bodies and spiders building their webs on plants.", "metadata": {"source": "data_file/context.txt"}}}
