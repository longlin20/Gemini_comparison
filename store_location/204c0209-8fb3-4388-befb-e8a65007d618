Advertisements produced by political campaigns usually included the statement, \"I'm [candidate's name], and I approve this message.\" Advertisements produced by independent organizations usually included the statement, \"[Organization name] is responsible for the content of this advertisement\", and from September 3 (60 days before the general election), such organizations' ads were prohibited from mentioning any candidate by name. Previously, television advertisements only required a written \"paid for by\" disclaimer on the screen.\nBreakage was very common in the shellac era. In the 1934 John O'Hara novel, Appointment in Samarra, the protagonist \"broke one of his most favorites, Whiteman's Lady of the Evening ... He wanted to cry but could not.\" A poignant moment in J. D. Salinger's 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye occurs after the adolescent protagonist buys a record for his younger sister but drops it and \"it broke into pieces ... I damn-near cried, it made me feel so terrible.\" A sequence where a school teacher's collection of 78 rpm jazz records is smashed by a group of rebellious students is a key moment in the film Blackboard Jungle.", "metadata": {"source": "data_file/context.txt"}}}
