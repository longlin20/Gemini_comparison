Purchased games and content from the PlayStation Network store are governed by PlayStation's Network Digital Rights Management (NDRM). The NDRM allows users to access the data from up to 2 different PlayStation 3's that have been activated using a user's PlayStation Network ID. PlayStation 3 also limits the transfer of copy protected videos downloaded from its store to other machines and states that copy protected video \"may not restore correctly\" following certain actions after making a backup such as downloading a new copy protected movie.\nA gramophone record (phonograph record in American English) or vinyl record, commonly known as a \"record\", is an analogue sound storage medium in the form of a flat polyvinyl chloride (previously shellac) disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc. Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12\", 10\", 7\"), the rotational speed in rpm at which they are played (16 2\u20443, 33 1\u20443, 45, 78), and their time capacity resulting from a combination of those parameters (LP \u2013 long playing 33 1\u20443 rpm, SP \u2013 78 rpm single, EP \u2013 12-inch single or extended play, 33 or 45 rpm); their reproductive quality or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc.), and the number of audio channels provided (mono, stereo, quad, etc.).", "metadata": {"source": "data_file/context.txt"}}}
