The Telnet protocol defined an ASCII \"Network Virtual Terminal\" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT. The File Transfer Protocol adopted the Telnet protocol, including use of the Network Virtual Terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ASCII mode. This adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for E-mail and the World Wide Web, on systems not using the NVT's CR-LF line-ending convention.\nTajikistan (i/t\u0251\u02d0\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0k\u1d7bst\u0251\u02d0n/, /t\u0259\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0k\u1d7bst\u00e6n/, or /t\u00e6\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0ki\u02d0st\u00e6n/; Persian: \u062a\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0643\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u200e\u200e \u0422\u043e\u04b7\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d [t\u0254d\u0361\u0292ik\u026as\u02c8t\u0254n]), officially the Republic of Tajikistan (Persian: \u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u062c\u064a\u0643\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u200e\u200e Tajik: \u04b6\u0443\u043c\u04b3\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0422\u043e\u04b7\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043d, \u00c7umhuriji To\u00e7ikiston/Jumhuriyi Tojikiston; Russian: \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0301\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0422\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d, Respublika Tadzhikistan), is a mountainous, landlocked country in Central Asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013, and an area of 143,100 km2 (55,300 sq mi).
