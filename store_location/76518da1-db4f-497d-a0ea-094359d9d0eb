He was driven by a sense of \"divine mission\", believing himself a conduit of Allah's will, and thought that he must achieve his goals \"no matter what the cost\". Raised within the Sunni branch of Islam, Gaddafi called for the implementation of sharia within Libya. He desired unity across the Islamic world, and encouraged the propagation of the faith elsewhere. On a 2010 visit to Italy, he paid a modelling agency to find 200 young Italian women for a lecture he gave urging them to convert. He also funded the construction and renovation of two mosques in Africa, including Uganda's Kampala Mosque. He nevertheless clashed with conservative Libyan clerics as to his interpretation of Islam. Many criticised his attempts to encourage women to enter traditionally male-only sectors of society, such as the armed forces. Gaddafi was keen to improve women's status, though saw the sexes as \"separate but equal\" and therefore felt women should usually remain in traditional roles.", "metadata": {"source": "data_file/context.txt"}}}
