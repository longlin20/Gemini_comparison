The word, and the concept of police itself, were \"disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression\" (according to Britannica 1911). Before the 19th century, the first use of the word \"police\" recorded in government documents in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798.\nPeople of Ashkenazi descent constitute around 47.5% of Israeli Jews (and therefore 35\u201336% of Israelis). They have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politics of Israel since its founding. During the first decades of Israel as a state, strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews (mainly east European Ashkenazim). The roots of this conflict, which still exists to a much smaller extent in present-day Israeli society, are chiefly attributed to the concept of the \"melting pot\". That is to say, all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to \"melt down\" their own particular exilic identities within the general social \"pot\" in order to become Israeli.", "metadata": {"source": "data_file/context.txt"}}}
